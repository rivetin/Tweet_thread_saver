## Problem

Twitter has many great people sharing valuable information in the form of threads. Write a personal script that uses the Twitter API to save the tweet thread in a suitable form for later consumption (maybe PDF or text file or a table view).

### Boot the bot ü§ñ
Apply for a twitter dev account and Replace the Keys and Secrets in `sample.env` and rename the file to `.env`

### Deploy the Bot 

```python3 mybot.py```  

a TXT file with tweets will be created 

### Dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è: 
tweepy    
dotenv
